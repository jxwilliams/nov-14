## How My App Works

- I built this project using Vite with a standard React setup.
For this assignment I focused on keeping the logic clear 
I tried to name my state variables in a way that makes sense for me when I come back to the code later.
The hardest part at first was making sure the shuffling animation and the final random choice both worked
without fighting each other. Once I stored the interval id in state and cleared it properly everything
felt much more stable .
